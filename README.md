## Introduction:
For every digital signal processing system, sampling analog signals is crucial. by using The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, which ensures complete signal recovery when sampling at a frequency twice that of actual signals.

## Tools:
  * Streamlit
  * HTML
  * CSS

## Features:
  * Browsing signals from saved ones.
  * Controlling signals by changing amplitude from (0:150) and frequency from(0:150hz).
  * controling Nyquist frequency in range (0.50:1.5).
  * controling signal to noise ratio (SNR) in range of (1:60dB).
  * Choosing type of signal you want to add.
  * Adding new signals and removing added ones from user-defined signal
  * Saving the generated signals.
  * Resizing/rescaling window.
  * For the signal plot:
      ** you can select the signal you want to show from 4 check boxes:
          *** Main signal
          *** Added signal
          *** Reconstructed signal
          *** Samples
