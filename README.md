# Title: SigView-Sampling-Studio
A digital signal processing website made using streamlit and customized using HTML and CSS where users can browse, generate, add, sample, and reconstruct a signal based on The Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem, and reconstruction is based on the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula.

## About:
 #### Team No.9
We are class of 2024 Systems and Biomedical Engineering, at Cairo university. We have designed this website for anyone interested in digital signal processing. Our website deals with the signals by plotting the signal, transforming, and controlling it through many parameters, any change in these parameters will be shown in real-time in the plot.
  
## Introduction:
For every digital signal processing system, sampling analog signals is crucial. by using The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, which ensures complete signal recovery when sampling at a frequency equals to double that of the maximum frequency of the combined signals.

## Tools:
  * Streamlit
  * HTML
  * CSS

## Features:
* Browsing signals from your machine
* Generate or Add signals by changing their amplitude and frequency
* Choosing the type of signal you want to generate or add
* Select and Remove added signals
* Sampling by the normal or maximum frequency
* Adding noise (SNR) to the signal with decibels
* Saving the reconstructed signals
* Responsive website
* For the signal plot:
  - you can select the signal you want to show from 4 checkboxes:
    - Main signal
    - Added signal
    - Reconstructed signal
    - Samples
