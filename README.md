## About:
 #### Team No.9
 We are class of 2024 biomedical engineering, Cairo university. We have designed this website for anyone who
 is interested in signal processing. Our website deals with the signals by plotting an original signal and controlling
 its feature through many parameters, any change in these parameters will be shown in the plot. We deal with sampled signals
 as well in an easy process with no time delay.
  
## Introduction:
For every digital signal processing system, sampling analog signals is crucial. by using The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, which ensures complete signal recovery when sampling at a frequency twice that of actual signals.

## Tools:
  * Streamlit
  * HTML
  * CSS

## Features:
  * Browsing signals from saved ones.
  * Controlling signals by changing amplitude from (0:150) and frequency from(0:150hz).
  * controling Nyquist frequency in range (0.50:1.5).
  * controling signal to noise ratio (SNR) in range of (1:60dB).
  * Choosing type of signal you want to add.
  * Adding new signals and removing added ones from user-defined signal
  * Saving the generated signals.
  * Resizing/rescaling window.
  * For the signal plot:
    - you can select the signal you want to show from 4 check boxes:
      - Main signal
      - Added signal
      - Reconstructed signal
      - Samples
