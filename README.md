## Introduction:
For every digital signal processing system, sampling analog signals is crucial. by using The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, which ensures complete signal recovery when sampling at a frequency twice that of actual signals.

## Tools:
  * Streamlit
  * HTML
  * CSS

## Features:
  * Browsing signals from saved ones.
  * Adding new signals and removing added ones from user-defined signal
  * Controlling signals by changing amplitude and frequency.
  * Adding noise to signal.
  * Saving the generated signals.
  * Resizing/rescaling window.
