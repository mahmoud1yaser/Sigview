##Introduction:
For every digital signal processing system, sampling analog signals is crucial. by using The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, which ensures complete signal recovery when sampling at a frequency twice that of actual signals.
##Tools:
  -Streamlit
  -HTML
  -CSS

##features:
  -Browsing signals from saved ones.
  -Adding new signals and removing added ones from user-defined signal
  -Controlling signals by changing amplitude and frequency.
  -Adding noise to signal.
  -Saving the generated signals.
  -Resizing/rescaling window.
